Easy to configure the list of input files.
Outputs the merged PDF as merged.pdf.

Requirements:

How to Use:
Copy and paste the PDF files you want to merge into the project folder (where the script is located).
Add the names of the PDF files to the pdffiles list (e.g., "1.pdf", "2.pdf").
Run the script to generate a single merged PDF file.

How to Run:
Ensure the required PDFs are in the project folder.
